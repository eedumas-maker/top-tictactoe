figuring out the winning code

let's run a for loop (might need to have it in some conditions, but that's ok)

it'll run until it hits the length of the array
it'll start from the edge, and check and see if that is equal to the next tile, and the next
it'll compare both the x axis and y axis

start with hard coding it (like grid[0][i] through grid[2][i])
    figure out the cascading comparison later on

if all three are true, break out of the loop, with a winner marked, and winning token
if none are true, then move to the next iteration

if it's the very last turn, and none are true, return Tie
    figure this out later

I can skip iterations with Continue, and I can jump out of a loop with break



(could you do something with if... and temp variable?
if grid[0][x] === grid[1][x]{
    grid[1][x] = temp;
}
if temp === grid[2][x]

(solve it one dimensionally first!)
a, b, c, d, == grid[0], grid[1], etc.



let grid = ["X", "X", "X"];
let temp = grid[0];

for(i = 0; i < grid.length-1; i++) //has to stop right before end, because it checks last tile in 

if (temp = grid[i+1]){
    grid[1+1] = temp; // set the temp to the next one, 

    if(i = length-1){
        win = true;
    } // check for last tile
}
else{
    break; 
}

works one-dimensionally, but that's it

        for (c = 0; c < grid.length; c++){ // c = column,  grid[r][c]
            
            for (r = 0; r < grid.length-1; r++){ // r = row
                
                let temp = grid[r][c];

                console.log("r = " + r + " and c = " + c);

                if(temp === ""){
                    console.log("empty space break");
                    break; // because all blanks would technically be three in a row...
                }

                if (temp === grid[r+1][c]){
                    grid[r][c] = temp;
                }
                else {
                    console.log("no match break");
                    break; // gotta quit checking if nobody matches
                }

                console.log("temp is: " + temp);

                if (r === grid.length-1){
                    win = true;
                    break;
                }
            }

            if(win === true){
                winner = grid[r][c];
                console.log("we have a winner! break")
                break;
            }
